1. For Each program, there are 20 marks.
2. Do not make changes to these files (`test1.js`), (`test2.js`)
3. To run your program on local run the command:
    ```bash
    node program1.js
    
    ```   
    ``` 
    node program2.py
4. To Execute the test script by run the command:
    ```bash
    npm run test1
    
    ```   
    ``` 
    npm run test2
5. Review the test results for each program. If all tests pass, the programs are working correctly.
6. Commit and push your code to the repository so that your test will be submitted.
